    <p>Hello tchr, first of all, thank you for teaching in our class 
      for almost 2 years with a lot of patience and care. I want you
      to know that we are very sorry for being naughty sometimes and 
      I'm also very sorry if I've done any inconvenience behaviors 
      toward you for this past 2 years that I didn't aware it will make
      you angry, sad or disappointed. Secondly, i know you already 
      been a very veryy good tchr to us and at some moment I also see 
     you as a mother figure to us or maybe it's just me but nevermind
      I just want to let you know that we love you for being a very patient, 
      lovely, caring and understanding tchr and also we love english!. Thirdly,
      you have been a good tchr that always assisting us when we have problems in 
      learning english especially grammars and though i have to admit that my grammar 
      still haven't reach a very satisfying level yet but as I grow up I'll never
      stop improving my english or become selfish with the helps and memories of
      your teaching in mind ❤️ also for your information i didn't use any internet or 
      google translate in process of making this letter, this is my pure english 😅 
      except for some word that I didn't know how to spell then terpaksa search a
      bit la only a bit I'm being honest ☺️ hopefully doesn't have a lot of 
      grammar error la 🤗 don't worry trial and spm I will do my very best and push 
      to my limit to get that A+ result for my english subject!anywayss it finally 
      come to an end of my letter, sorry for taking so long hihi happyy teacher's 
      dayy to youu!! may you have a special day teacher 🫶🏻 very sincerely from me, melvyna 5.1</p>

    <p>happy teachers day to you teacher Alizah! thank
      you for teaching us biology and also for always caring for 
      all of us in the class, being patient with us, giving us 
      ways to improve ourselves, reminding us to always pray and 
      also to believe in ourselves. it means a lot really to know 
      that there is a teacher that cares about these things. it 
      may seem small and simple to you teacher, but to me it's 
      very big as i haven't met a teacher like you, teacher 
      btul" the first one and tcer mcm another mom to me (bkn 
      sy ja yg feel this way ni tcer, ada yg lain pun rsa bgni!) ! 
      i promise i'll try my best to get good marks for all my 
      subjects (especially biology). smoga spm sy straight A and bio 
      sy A+ (Amen ya tcer, doakan sy huhu) love you teacher 🫰🏻🫶🏻</p>
