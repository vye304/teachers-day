    <p>Hello tchr, first of all, thank you for teaching in our class 
      for almost 2 years with a lot of patience and care. I want you
      to know that we are very sorry for being naughty sometimes and 
      I'm also very sorry if I've done any inconvenience behaviors 
      toward you for this past 2 years that I didn't aware it will make
      you angry, sad or disappointed. Secondly, i know you already 
      been a very veryy good tchr to us and at some moment I also see 
     you as a mother figure to us or maybe it's just me but nevermind
      I just want to let you know that we love you for being a very patient, 
      lovely, caring and understanding tchr and also we love english!. Thirdly,
      you have been a good tchr that always assisting us when we have problems in 
      learning english especially grammars and though i have to admit that my grammar 
      still haven't reach a very satisfying level yet but as I grow up I'll never
      stop improving my english or become selfish with the helps and memories of
      your teaching in mind ❤️ also for your information i didn't use any internet or 
      google translate in process of making this letter, this is my pure english 😅 
      except for some word that I didn't know how to spell then terpaksa search a
      bit la only a bit I'm being honest ☺️ hopefully doesn't have a lot of 
      grammar error la 🤗 don't worry trial and spm I will do my very best and push 
      to my limit to get that A+ result for my english subject!anywayss it finally 
      come to an end of my letter, sorry for taking so long hihi happyy teacher's
